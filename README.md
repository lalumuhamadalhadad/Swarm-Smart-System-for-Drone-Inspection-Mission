# Swarm-Smart-System-for-Drone-Inspection-Mission
This project was developed as part of my Master’s thesis. The main objectives of this work are:

1. To develop a flight path optimization algorithm for indoor swarm drone inspection missions.
2. To simulate the environment and drone flights based on the optimized flight paths.
3. To create a realistic simulation, incorporating practical flight dynamics and system constraints.

# How to Run the Code
To run this project, please follow the steps below:

1. Refer to the original simulation developers’ website to install the required dependencies.
2. Run the Optimizer module (Optimizer Integrated.py) to generate an optimized flight plan for the inspection mission.
3. Configure the required parameters, including flight altitude, building geometry, number of drones, starting positions, and other mission settings.
4. Insert the waypoints generated by the optimizer manually into the simulation code. A dedicated section for waypoint insertion is provided in the simulation script.
5. Run the simulation using MainSim.py. A visualization window will appear to display the inspection progress.
6. After the simulation is completed, several reports will be generated, including flight performance metrics and mission results.

# Note
The simulation environment and dynamic integration code (gym-pybullet-drones) are modified versions of the original implementation developed by the research group at the University of Cambridge’s Prorok Lab. The modifications primarily focus on adapting the control logic to support a flight path optimization algorithm. Several flight dynamics limiters have been introduced to ensure stable and safe maneuvering, and a PID control system has been integrated to enhance trajectory tracking performance and overall control robustness.
